Features Folder
================

1. api: All the fetch logic goes here. This decouples the API and the UI.
2. components: Feature specific components.
3. composables: Feature specific composables.
4. stores: The state management code. Multiple sub-modules are expected and actually encouraged.
5. types: Feature specific typeScript type definitions.
6. index.ts: This is the entry point of the feature. It behaves as the public API of the feature, and it should only export things that should be public for other parts of the application.

***
The aboveindex.ts file serves as the public API of each feature. When importing something from another domain it should be done only through this file. This should prevent circular dependencies, and also make it easier to find the source of an import.
